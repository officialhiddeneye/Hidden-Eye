                                                                                        ### Note                                                                                - The script assumes the existence of specific sound files (`Access-Granted.mp3`, `Jarvis2.mp3`, `JARVIS.mp3`) and a Python script (`sound_effect.py`), which are moved to the `Song` directory.
- The `network.py` script is moved to the `NETWORK` directory.

### Files Moved
- `login.sh`: Customized login script.
- `delete.sh`: Cleanup script (assumed to be present in the `Hidden-Eye` directory).
- `setup.sh`: Setup script for automating installation.
